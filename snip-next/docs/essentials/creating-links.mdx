## Creating a Link

To create a link, navigate to the dashboard and click the **New Link** button.

### Fields

| Field | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Destination URL** | The long URL you want to shorten. Must be a valid URL. | Yes |
| **Title** | A friendly name for your link. If left blank, we'll try to fetch the title from the destination page. | No |
| **Custom Alias** | A custom back-half for your link (e.g. `snip.com/summer-sale`). | No |

## Editing a Link

You can edit the destination URL, title, and other settings of a link at any time.

1. Go to the **Links** page.
2. Click on the link you want to edit.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Make your changes and click **Save**.

<Warning>
  Changing the custom alias will break the old link. Make sure to update any places where you've shared the old link.
</Warning>

## Deleting a Link

To delete a link:

1. Go to the **Links** page.
2. Click the three dots menu next to the link.
3. Select **Delete**.
4. Confirm the deletion.

  Deleting a link is permanent and cannot be undone. The short link will stop working immediately.
