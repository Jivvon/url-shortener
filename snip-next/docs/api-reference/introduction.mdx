## Base URL

The Snip API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

```bash
https://api.snip.com/v1
```

## Authentication

The Snip API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard](https://snip.com/dashboard/settings).

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Response Codes

Snip uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `200` | **OK** - The request was successful. |
| `201` | **Created** - The resource was successfully created. |
| `400` | **Bad Request** - The request was invalid or cannot be served. |
| `401` | **Unauthorized** - Missing or invalid authentication. |
| `403` | **Forbidden** - You do not have permission to access the resource. |
| `404` | **Not Found** - The requested resource could not be found. |
| `429` | **Too Many Requests** - You have exceeded the rate limit. |
| `500` | **Internal Server Error** - Something went wrong on our end. |
